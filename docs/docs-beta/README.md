# Dagster Docs - Beta

This is the home of the new Dagster documentation. It is currently in beta and incomplete.
The documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

The site uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management. 
It also uses [vale](https://vale.sh/) to check for issues in the documentation.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
brew install pnpm vale
pnpm install
```

### Overview of the docs

Code in `./src` contains custom components, styles, themes, and layouts.
Code `./content-templates` contains the templates for the documentation pages.
Code in `./docs/` is the source of truth for the documentation.

`./docs/code_examples` contains all code examples for the documentation. 

The docs are broken down into the following sections:
- [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/)
- [Guides](./docs/guides/)
- [Concepts](./docs/concepts/)

`sidebar.ts` and `docusaurus.config.ts` are the main configuration files for the documentation.

### Local Development

To start the local development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. Access the website at [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050).


To lint the documentation for issues:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

To autofix linting issues and format with prettier:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```



### Build

To build the site for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
