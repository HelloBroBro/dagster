### About this integration

With this integration you can trigger Hightouch syncs and monitor them from within Dagster. Fine-tune when Hightouch syncs kick-off, visualize their dependencies, and monitor the steps in your data activation workflow.

This native integration helps your team more effectively orchestrate the last mile of data analyticsâ€”bringing that data from the warehouse back into the SaaS tools your business teams live in. With the `dagster-hightouch` integration, Hightouch users have more granular and sophisticated control over when data gets activated.

### Installation

```bash
pip install dagster-hightouch
```

### Example

```python
from dagster import job
from dagster_hightouch.ops import hightouch_sync_op
from dagster_hightouch.resources import ht_resource
import os

HT_ORG = "39619"

run_ht_sync_orgs = hightouch_sync_op.configured(
    {"sync_id": HT_ORG}, name="hightouch_sfdc_organizations"
)

@job(
    resource_defs={
        "hightouch": ht_resource.configured(
            {"api_key": os.environ['HIGHTOUCH_API_KEY']},
        ),
    }
)
def ht_sfdc_job():
    ht_orgs = run_ht_sync_orgs()
```
