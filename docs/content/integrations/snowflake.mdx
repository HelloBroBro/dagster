# Snowflake & Dagster

Using Dagster's [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and Snowflake I/O manager, you can easily interact with Snowflake tables alongside other Dagster assets.

Managing your Snowflake tables with Dagster enables you to:

- Use Python to analyze your data stored in Snowflake without writing custom SQL queries to fetch the data
- Visualize the data dependencies between tables
- Selectively update the contents of your tables
- Integrate your Snowflake tables with other tools in your data stack
