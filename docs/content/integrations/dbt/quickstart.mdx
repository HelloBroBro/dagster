# Quickstart: Run your dbt project with Dagster

<Note>
  <strong>Note</strong>: This guide uses the <code>DbtProject</code> class,
  which is an experimental feature. Visit the{" "}
  <a href="/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt#dagster_dbt.DbtProject">
    dagster-dbt library API reference
  </a>{" "}
  for more info.
</Note>

## Setup your environment

<Note>
  <strong>Note</strong>: We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a
  Python virtualenv. Visit the{" "}
  <a href="/getting-started/install">Dagster installation docs</a> for more
  info.
</Note>

Install dbt, Dagster, and the Dagster webserver. Run the following to install everything using pip:

```shell
pip install dagster-dbt dagster-webserver
```

The `dagster-dbt` library installs both `dbt-core` and `dagster` as dependencies. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info.

## Load your dbt project in Dagster

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Option 1: Create a single Dagster file">

Running your dbt project with Dagster can be easily done after creating a single file. For this example, let's consider a basic use case - say you want to represent your dbt models as Dagster assets and run them daily at midnight.

With your text editor of choice, create a Python file in the same directory as your dbt project directory and add the following code. Note that since this file contains [all Dagster definitions required for your code location](/concepts/code-locations), it is recommended to name it `definitions.py`.

The following code assumes that your Python file and dbt project directory are adjacent in the same directory. If that's not the case, make sure to update the `RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT` constant so that it points to your dbt project.

```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart/with_single_file.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from pathlib import Path

from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, Definitions
from dagster_dbt import (
    DbtCliResource,
    DbtProject,
    build_schedule_from_dbt_selection,
    dbt_assets,
)

RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT = "./my_dbt_project"

my_project = DbtProject(
    project_dir=Path(__file__)
    .joinpath("..", RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT)
    .resolve(),
)


@dbt_assets(manifest=my_project.manifest_path)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()


my_schedule = build_schedule_from_dbt_selection(
    [my_dbt_assets],
    job_name="materialize_dbt_models",
    cron_schedule="0 0 * * *",
    dbt_select="fqn:*",
)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[my_dbt_assets],
    schedules=[my_schedule],
    resources={
        "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=my_project),
    },
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Option 2: Create a new Dagster project">

You can create a Dagster project that wraps your dbt project by using the `dagster-dbt` command line interface.

To use the command, you'll need to provide two options:

- `--project-name`, the name of your Dagster project to be created, and
- `--dbt-project-dir`, the path to your dbt project.

In our example, our Dagster project is named `my_dagster_project` and the relative path to our dbt project is `./my_dbt_project`, meaning that we are in the directory where `my_dbt_project` is located.

```shell
dagster-dbt project scaffold --project-name my_dagster_project --dbt-project-dir ./my_dbt_project --use-experimental-dbt-project
```

This command creates a new directory called `my_dagster_project/` inside the current directory. The new `my_dagster_project/` directory will contain a set of files that define a Dagster project to load the dbt project provided in `./my_dbt_project`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Option 3: Use an existing Dagster project">

You can use an existing Dagster project to run your dbt project. To do so, you'll need to add some objects using the [dagster-dbt library](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt) and update your `Definitions` object. This example assumes that your existing Dagster project includes both `assets.py` and `definitions.py` files, among other required files.

```shell
my_dagster_project
├── __init__.py
├── assets.py
├── definitions.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
└── setup.py
```

1. Change directories to the Dagster project directory:

   ```shell
   cd my_dagster_project/
   ```

2. Create a Python file named `project.py` and add the following code. The DbtProject object is a representation of your dbt project that assist with managing `manifest.json` preparation.

   ```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart/with_project.py startafter=start_dbt_project_example endbefore=end_dbt_project_example
   from pathlib import Path

   from dagster_dbt import DbtProject

   RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT = "./my_dbt_project"

   my_project = DbtProject(
       project_dir=Path(__file__)
       .joinpath("..", RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT)
       .resolve(),
   )
   ```

3. In your `assets.py` file, add the following code. Using the `dbt_assets` decorator allows Dagster to create a definition for how to compute a set of dbt resources, described by a `manifest.json`.

   ```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart/with_project.py startafter=start_dbt_assets_example endbefore=end_dbt_assets_example
   from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
   from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

   from .project import my_project

   @dbt_assets(manifest=my_project.manifest_path)
   def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
       yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
   ```

4. In your `definitions.py` file, update your Definitions object to include the newly created objects.

   ```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart/with_project.py startafter=start_dbt_definitions_example endbefore=end_dbt_definitions_example
   from dagster import Definitions
   from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource

   from .assets import my_dbt_assets
   from .project import my_project

   defs = Definitions(
       ...,
       assets=[
           ...,
           # Add the dbt assets alongside your other asset
           my_dbt_assets,
       ],
       resources={
           ...: ...,
           # Add the dbt resource alongside your other resources
           "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=my_project),
       },
   )
   ```

With these changes, your existing Dagster project is ready to run your dbt project.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Run your dbt project in Dagster's UI

Now that your code is ready, you can run Dagster's UI to take a look at your dbt project.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Option 1: From a Dagster file">

1. Locate the Dagster file containing your definitions. If you followed our example to create a single Dagster file in the [previous section](#load-your-dbt-project-in-dagster), your file should be named `definitions.py`.

2. To start Dagster's UI, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagster dev -f definitions.py
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Option 2: From a Dagster project">

1. Change directories to the Dagster project directory:

   ```shell
   cd my_dagster_project/
   ```

2. To start Dagster's UI, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagster dev
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the asset graph for the job created by the schedule definition:

<!--
![Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets](/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset_graph.png)
-->

<Image
alt="Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets"
src="/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset_graph.png"
width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

In Dagster, running a dbt model corresponds to _materializing_ an asset. Because a schedule definition has been added to your code location, your assets will be materialized at the next cron tick. The assets can also be materialized manually by click the **Materialize all** button near the top right corner of the page. This will launch a run to materialize the assets.
