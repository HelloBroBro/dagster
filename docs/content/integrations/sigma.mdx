# Using Dagster with Sigma

<ExperimentalCallout />

This guide provides instructions for using Dagster with Sigma using the `dagster-sigma` library. Your Sigma assets, including datasets and workbooks, can be represented in the Dagster asset graph, allowing you to track lineage and dependencies between Sigma assets and upstream data assets you are already modeling in Dagster.

## What you'll learn

- How to represent Sigma assets in the Dagster asset graph, including lineage to other Dagster assets.
- How to customize asset definition metadata for these Sigma assets.

<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

- The `dagster-sigma` library installed in your environment
- Familiarity with asset definitions and the Dagster asset graph
- Familiarity with Dagster resources
- Familiarity with Sigma concepts, like datasets and workbooks
- A Sigma organization
- A Sigma client ID and client secret. For more information, see [Generate API client credentials](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/generate-client-credentials#generate-api-client-credentials) in the Sigma documentation.

</details>

## Set up your environment

To get started, you'll need to install the `dagster` and `dagster-sigma` Python packages:

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-sigma
```

## Represent Sigma assets in the asset graph

To load Sigma assets into the Dagster asset graph, you must first construct a <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="SigmaOrganization" /> resource, which allows Dagster to communicate with your Sigma organization. You'll need to supply your client ID and client secret alongside the base URL. See [Identify your API request URL](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/get-started-sigma-api#identify-your-api-request-url) in the Sigma documentation for more information on how to find your base URL.

Dagster can automatically load all datasets and workbooks Æ’rom your Sigma workspace. Call the <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="SigmaOrganization" method="build_defs" /> function, which returns a `Definitions` object containing all the asset definitions for these Sigma assets.

```python file=/integrations/sigma/representing-sigma-assets.py
from dagster_sigma import SigmaBaseUrl, SigmaOrganization

import dagster as dg

resource = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

defs = resource.build_defs()
```

### Customize asset definition metadata for Sigma assets

By default, Dagster will generate asset keys for each Sigma asset based on its type and name and populate default metadata. You can further customize asset properties by passing a custom <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="DagsterSigmaTranslator" /> subclass to the <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="SigmaOrganization" method="build_defs" /> function. This subclass can implement methods to customize the asset keys or specs for each Sigma asset type.

```python file=/integrations/sigma/customize-sigma-asset-defs.py
from dagster_sigma import (
    DagsterSigmaTranslator,
    SigmaBaseUrl,
    SigmaOrganization,
    SigmaWorkbook,
)

import dagster as dg

resource = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)


# A translator class lets us customize properties of the built Sigma assets, such as the owners or asset key
class MyCustomSigmaTranslator(DagsterSigmaTranslator):
    def get_workbook_spec(self, data: SigmaWorkbook) -> dg.AssetSpec:
        # Adds a custom team owner tag to all reports
        return super().get_asset_spec(data)._replace(owners=["my_team"])


defs = resource.build_defs(dagster_sigma_translator=MyCustomSigmaTranslator)
```

### Load Sigma assets from multiple organizations

Definitions from multiple Sigma organizations can be combined by instantiating multiple <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="SigmaOrganization" /> resources and merging their definitions. This lets you view all your Sigma assets in a single asset graph:

```python file=/integrations/sigma/multiple-sigma-organizations.py
from dagster_sigma import SigmaBaseUrl, SigmaOrganization

import dagster as dg

sales_team_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SALES_SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SALES_SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

marketing_team_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("MARKETING_SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("MARKETING_SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

defs = dg.Definitions.merge(
    sales_team_organization.build_defs(),
    marketing_team_organization.build_defs(),
)
```
