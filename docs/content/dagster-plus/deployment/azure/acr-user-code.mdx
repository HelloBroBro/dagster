# Deploying user code in Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Dagster+

This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up a new repository for your Dagster code, setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions backed by Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploying your code to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

This guide assumes you already have an AKS agent running. You can follow along [here](/dagster-plus/deployment/azure/aks-agent) if you still need to set up an AKS agent.

## Prerequisites

This guide will use a Github repository to store the Dagster code, and GitHub Actions to deploy the code to Azure Container Registry. If you need to use another CI/CD provider, such as Azure DevOps, the steps here will need to be adapted. Check out our guide on configuring CI/CD using the `dagster-cloud` CLI [here](/dagster-plus/getting-started#step-4-configure-cicd-for-your-project).

- The azure CLI installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- A GitHub account, and the ability to run GitHub Actions workflows in a repository.

## Step 1: Creating a repository for Dagster code.

We'll create a new repository based on the [Dagster+ hybrid quickstart repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart). We'll go through these steps using a brand new repository in GitHub, but you should be able to adapt these steps to an existing repository or other version control systems.

First, [create a new repository in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). Going forward, we'll refer to this repository as `dagster-plus-code`.

Next, we'll run a few commands which clone both our new repository and the Dagster+ hybrid quickstart repository to our local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> dagster-plus-code
git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart.git
```

We'll copy the contents of the `dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart` repository into our `dagster-plus-code` repository, and commit the changes.

```bash
rsync -av --exclude='.git' dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/ dagster-plus-code/
cd dagster-plus-code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
```

### Project structure

The project has the following structure:

```plaintext
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── dagster-cloud-deploy.yml # GitHub Actions workflow for re-deploying code location
├── .vscode # Standard VSCode settings for working with a Dagster repository
├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile for building the user code image
├── README.md
├── dagster_cloud.yaml # Configuration file describing all code locations in the repository
├── pyproject.toml # Python project configuration file for the code location
├── quickstart_etl # Python package containing the user code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── __init__.py

│   └── definitions.py
├── quickstart_etl_tests # User code tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_assets.py
├── setup.cfg
└── setup.py
```

## Step 2: Setting up an Azure Container Registry

Next, we'll set up an Azure Container Registry to store our Docker images. We'll use the Azure CLI to create the registry.

```bash
az login
az acr create --resource-group <your_resource_group> --name <your-acr-name> --sku Basic
```

Then, we'll make images from our ACR available to our AKS cluster.

```bash
az aks update -n <your-cluster-name> -g <your_resource_group> --attach-acr <your-acr-name>
```

## Step 3: Setting up GitHub Actions

Now, we'll set up a Github Actions workflow to build and push our Docker image to Azure Container Registry.

We already have a GitHub Actions workflow in our repository, located at `.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml`. This workflow will build the Docker image, push it to ACR, and update the code location in Dagster+. To get it working with your repository, you'll need to do a few things.

#### Generate Azure credentials

First, we'll need to generate a service principal for GitHub Actions to use to authenticate with Azure. We'll use the Azure CLI to create the service principal.

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions-acr" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<your_azure_subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<your_resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<your_acr_name>
```

This command will output a JSON object with the service principal details. Make sure to save the `appId`, `password`, and `tenant` values - we'll use them in the next step.

### Add secrets to your repository

We'll add the service principal details as secrets in our repository. Go to your repository in GitHub, and navigate to `Settings` -> `Secrets`. Add the following secrets:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The `appId` from the service principal JSON object.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The `password` from the service principal JSON object.

### Update the workflow

Finally, we'll update the workflow to use the service principal details. Open `.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml` in your repository, and uncomment the section on Azure Container Registry. It should look like this:

```yaml
# Azure Container Registry (ACR)
# https://github.com/docker/login-action#azure-container-registry-acr
- name: Login to Azure Container Registry
  if: steps.prerun.outputs.result != 'skip'
  uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    registry: ${{ env.IMAGE_REGISTRY }}
    username: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    password: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
```

### Push and run the workflow

Now, commit and push the changes to your repository. The GitHub Actions workflow should run automatically. You can check the status of the workflow in the `Actions` tab of your repository.

<Image

When the workflow completes, you should see the new code location in Dagster+. Navigate to the `Status` page, and click the `Code Locations` tab. You should see your new code location listed.
