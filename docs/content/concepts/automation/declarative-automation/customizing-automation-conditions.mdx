# Creating custom Declarative Automation conditions

[Declarative Automation](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation) includes pre-built conditions to handle common use cases, such as executing on a periodic schedule or whenever an upstream dependency updates, but the core system is extremely flexible and can be tailored to your specific needs.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" pluralize /> work and how to create your own custom conditions.

---

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Declarative Automation](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation)

---

## How it works

Each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> consists of a set of **operands** and various **operators**. To create conditions that suit your needs, you can combine the operators and operands listed below. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

in_progress_or_failed_parents = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.in_progress() | AutomationCondition.failed()
)
```

This condition translates to **Any upstream dependencies (parents) are part of an in-progress run or failed during the latest run**.

### Operands

Operands are base conditions which can be true or false about a given target. For partitioned assets, the target will be a given partition of the asset.

| Operand                                     | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AutomationCondition.missing`               | Target has not been executed                                                                                         |
| `AutomationCondition.in_progress`           | Target is part of an in-progress run                                                                                 |
| `AutomationCondition.execution_failed`      | Target failed to be executed in its latest run                                                                       |
| `AutomationCondition.newly_updated`         | Target was updated since the previous evaluation                                                                     |
| `AutomationCondition.newly_requested`       | Target was requested on the previous evaluation                                                                      |
| `AutomationCondition.code_version_changed`  | Target has a new code version since the previous evaluation                                                          |
| `AutomationCondition.cron_tick_passed`      | A new tick of the provided cron schedule occurred since the previous evaluation                                      |
| `AutomationCondition.in_latest_time_window` | Target falls within the latest time window of the assetâ€™s <PyObject object="PartitionsDefinition" />, if applicable. |
| `AutomationCondition.will_be_requested`     | Target will be requested in this tick                                                                                |
| `AutomationCondition.initial_evaluation`    | This is the first evaluation of this condition                                                                       |

### Operators

The above conditions can be built into more complex expressions using the following operators:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "40%",
        }}
      >
        Operator
      </th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>~</code> (tilde)
      </td>
      <td>
        NOT; condition is not true; ex: <code>~A</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>|</code> (pipe)
      </td>
      <td>
        OR; either condition is true; ex: <code>A | B</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>&</code> (ampersand)
      </td>
      <td>
        AND; both conditions are true; ex: <code>A & B</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>A.newly_true()</code>
      </td>
      <td>Condition A was false on the previous evaluation and is now true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>A.since(B)</code>
      </td>
      <td>Condition A became true more recently than Condition B.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(A)</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Condition A is true for any upstream partition. Can be used with{" "}
        <code>.allow()</code> and <code>.ignore()</code> to target specific
        upstream assets. Refer to the{" "}
        <a href="#targeting-dependencies">Targeting dependencies</a> section for
        an example.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>AutomationCondition.all_deps_match(A)</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Condition A is true for at least one partition of each upstream asset.
        Can be used with <code>.allow()</code> and <code>.ignore()</code> to
        target specific upstream assets. Refer to the{" "}
        <a href="#targeting-dependencies">Targeting dependencies</a> section for
        an example.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>AutomationCondition.any_downstream_condition()</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Any <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> on a downstream asset
        evaluates to true
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Composite conditions

Finally, there are a set of pre-built conditions which make it easier to construct common combinations of the above conditions.

| Condition                                         | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AutomationCondition.any_deps_updated`            | Any dependencies have been updated since the previous evaluation                       |
| `AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing`            | Any dependencies have never been materialized or observed                              |
| `AutomationCondition.any_deps_in_progress`        | Any dependencies are part of an in-progress run                                        |
| `AutomationCondition.all_deps_updated_since_cron` | All dependencies have been updated since the latest tick of the provided cron schedule |

---

## Modifying policies

It's common to have use cases similar to pre-built policies but with minor differences. While it is always possible to copy the base implementation and modify it as needed, it can often be simpler to use the `.without()` method to remove the unwanted sub-conditions or add additional conditions with the `&` operator.

### `AutomationCondition.eager()`: Ignoring missing upstream data

By default, `AutomationCondition.eager()` will not materialize a target if it has any missing upstream data. If it is expected to have missing upstream data, remove `~AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing()` from the eager policy to allow execution:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

condition = AutomationCondition.eager().without(
  ~AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing(),
)
```

### `AutomationCondition.eager()`: Update older time partitions

By default, `AutomationCondition.eager()` will only update the latest time partition of an asset. If updates to historical partitions should result in downstream updates, then this sub-condition can be removed:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

condition = AutomationCondition.eager().without(
  AutomationCondition.in_latest_time_window(),
)
```

## Targeting dependencies

Upstream assets commonly influence downstream materialization decisions. To create automation conditions that target dependencies, use the `AutomationCondition.any_deps_match()` operator. This operator takes an arbitrary <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />, applies it to each upstream asset, and then maps the results to the corresponding downstream partitions.

This operator and `AutomationCondition.all_deps_match()` can be further customized to only target specific sets of upstream assets by using `.allow()` and `.ignore()`.

For example, to target updates from a specific asset group, you can use `any_deps_match` with the `newly_updated` operand and tell it to target only the `metrics` asset group:

```python
from dagster import AssetSelection, AutomationCondition

AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.newly_updated()
).allow(AssetSelection.groups("metrics"))
```

Or to ignore missing partitions from an upstream asset, you can use `any_deps_match` with the `missing` operand and tell it to ignore a specific asset:

```python
AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.missing()
).ignore(AssetSelection.keys("taxi_trips"))
```

Note that these `ignore()` and `allow()` methods also work for composite conditions such as `AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing()` or `AutomationCondition.any_deps_updated()`.

## Describing conditions with labels

When there are a large number of sub-conditions that make up an <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />, it can be difficult to understand and troubleshoot the condition. To make conditions easier to understand, you can attach labels to sub-conditions, which will then be displayed in the Dagster UI.

Arbitrary string labels can be attached to any node in the <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> tree by using the `with_label()` method, allowing you to describe the purpose of a specific sub-condition. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

in_progress_or_failed_parents = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.in_progress() | AutomationCondition.failed()
).with_label("Any parents in progress or failed")
```

Then, when viewing evaluation results in the UI, the label will display next to the condition:

<!-- ![Any parents in progress or failed condition label in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label.png) -->

<Image
alt="Any parents in progress or failed condition label in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label.png"
width={1576}
height={418}
/>

Hovering over or expanding the label will display its sub-conditions:

<!-- ![Expanded Any parents in progress or failed condition label with a list of sub-conditions in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label-expanded.png) -->

<Image
alt="Expanded Any parents in progress or failed condition label with a list of sub-conditions in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label-expanded.png"
width={1576}
height={593}
/>

## Arbitary Python AutomationConditions <Experimental />

Some automation use cases require custom business logic that cannot be expressed with off-the-shelf components. In these cases, you can define AutomationConditions which execute arbitrary python code, and compose them with the built-in conditions.

### Setup

By default, Dagster executes `AutomationConditionSensorDefinitions` in a daemon process that does not have access to your user code. In order to execute arbitrary Python code, you'll need to update this to execute on your user code server. This is the same place that your `@sensor` methods are evaluated.

<Note>
  Automation condition evaluation can be more resource-intensive than a typical
  sensor. A limit of 500 assets or checks per sensor is enforced.
</Note>

To do this, add an automation condition sensor to your definitions with the `use_user_code_server` flag set to `True`:

```python
import dagster as dg

defs = dg.Definitions(
  sensors=[dg.AutomationConditionSensorDefinition("automation_condition_sensor", target=dg.AssetSelection.all(), use_user_code_server=True)]
)
```

This will allow your sensor to target automation conditions containing custom python code.

### Defining a custom condition

You can create your own subclass of `AutomationCondition`, defining the `evaluate()` method. For example, imagine you want to avoid executing anything on a company holiday. To do this, you can first define a condition which detects if it's currently a company holiday:

```python
import dagster as dg

class IsCompanyHoliday(dg.AutomationCondition):
  def evaluate(self, context: dg.AutomationContext) -> dg.AutomationResult:
    if is_company_holiday(context.evaluation_time):
      true_subset = context.candidate_subset
    else:
      true_subset = context.get_empty_subset()
    return dg.AutomationResult(true_subset, context=context)

```

In this example, we build up a subset of the evaluated asset for which this condition is True. We use `EntitySubsets`, rather than a pure `True` / `False` to account for partitioned assets, for which individual partitions may have different results.

In our case, the condition will be applied the same regardless of if it's partitioned or not, so we don't need to have any special logic to differntiate between these cases. If it's not a company holiday, we can return an empty subset (meaning that this condition is not true for any subset of the asset), and if it is a company holiday, we return the `candidate_subset`, which is the subset of the asset that we need to evaluate. This subset shrinks as we filter partitions out using the `&` condition, so if you have an expression `A & B`, and `A` returns the empty subset, then the candidate subset for `B` will be empty as well. This helps avoid expensive computation in cases where we know it won't impact the final output.

Once this condition is defined, you can use this condition as part of a broader expression, for example:

```python
import dagster as dg

condition = AutomationCondition.eager() & ~IsCompanyHoliday()
```
